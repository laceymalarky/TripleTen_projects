# Time Series Forecasting
## Project Overview
A Taxi company provided historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, I built a model to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour.

## Machine Learning Skills/Technologies
Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), Cross-validation, Autocorellation, Hyperparameter tuning, Trends and Seasonality Analysis

## Project Conclusions
- Developed [forecasting models](https://github.com/laceymalarky/TripleTen_projects/blob/main/time_series_forecasting/forecasting_model.ipynb) to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour, achieving a 15% improvement in the evaluation metric (RMSE).
- Performed feature engineering to optimize the data for time series modeling.

## Requirements
Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn, xgboost

## Data Description:
- training and testing set of ##
  - `taxi.csv`
    - `datetime` — timestamp
    - `num_orders` — number of orders
